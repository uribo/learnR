# Assignment

Assignment may be one of the most fundamental expressions in all programming languages. What it does is to assign, or bind a value to a symbol so that we can refer to the value by that symbol later.

Despite the similarity, R adopts the operator `<-` to perform assignment. This is a bit different from many other languages which use `=`, although it is also allowed in R.

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- c(1,2,3)
z <- list(x,y)
```

We don't have to declare the symbol and its type before assigning a value to it. If a symbol does not exist in the environment, assignment will create that symbol. If a symbol already exists, assignment will not end up in conflict but rebind the new value to that symbol.

There are some alternative yet equivalent operators we can use.

```{r}
2 -> x1
x2 = c(1,2,3)
```

We can even chain the assignment operators so that a set of symbols all take the same value.

```{r}
x3 <- x2 <- x1 <- 0
```

The expression `0` is evaluated only once so that the same value is assigned to the three symbols. To verify how it works, we can change `0` to a random number generator.

```{r}
x3 <- x2 <- x1 <- rnorm(1)
c(x1,x2,x3)
```

`rnorm(1)` generates a random number following the standard normal distribution. If each assignment re-invokes the random number generator, each symbol will have different values. But in fact, it does not happen. Later we will explain what really happens and you will have a better understanding on it.

## Quotation

Assignment operators allow us to assign a value to a symbol (or name). However, direct assignment limits the format of the name. A symbol must start with a to z or ., and cannot directly contain spaces. Otherwise, we need to use quotation marks to use any name we want.

```{r}
`_a?` <- 1
```

The quotation marks can be used in any place where we create a symbol.

```{r}
`-a` <- function(a,d) { a-d }
l1 <- list(`a+-`=rnorm(10),`a-+`=rnorm(10))
```

If the symbol name cannot be validly referred to directly, we also need to use the quotation marks to refer to the symbol.

```{r}
`-a`(1,2)
l1$`a+-`
```

An exception is `data.frame`. Even if we use quotation marks around a name with unusual symbols, the resulted `data.frame` will replace those symbols with `.`.

```{r}
data.frame(`a-+`=rnorm(10),`a+-`=rnorm(10))
```
