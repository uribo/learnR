# Statistical functions

As a statistical computing environment, R provides a variety of easy-to-use statistical functions from random sampling to statistical tests. Although these built-in functions are limited, they are sufficient to handle many basic statistical problems.

## Random sampling

Random sampling is perhaps the first step of answering most statisitical questions on a population. Given a vector or a list, `sample()` function draws a sample from it with or without replacement.

For example, draw a sample of size 2 from a numeric vector without replacement.

```{r}
sample(c(1,2,3),size=2,replace=FALSE)
```

Another example, draw a sample of size 10 from a character vector with replacement.

```{r}
sample(c("a","b","z"),size=10,replace=TRUE)
```

`sample()` also supports unequal weights over each observation while sampling.

```{r}
sample(c("Good","Medium","Poor"),size=10,replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.1,0.8,0.1))
```


## Sampling from distributions

Instead of drawing samples from a given vector or list, R also provides a set of functions to draw random samples from popular probability distributions.

### Uniform distribution

Uniform distribution is the simplest random distribution. Under uniform distribution, it is equally probable to draw any value out of a given range. To produce such a random sample, we can call

```{r}
runif(10)
```

A random sample of size 10, represented by a numeric vector, is drawn from the uniform distribution with range $[0,1]$. To customize the range, we can specify `min=` and `max=` arguments 

```{r}
runif(10,min = -5,max = 5)
```

so that another sample uniformly distributed within $[-5,5]$ is drawn.

In addition to a simple random number generator, some relavent functions are also provided, including the probability density function `dunif()`, the cumulative density function `punif()`, and quantile function `qunif()`.

```{r unif,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(runif(10000),main="Histogram of runif(10000)")
plot(dunif,xlim=c(-1,1),main="dunif")
plot(punif,xlim=c(-1,1),main="punif")
plot(qunif,xlim=c(0,1),main="qunif")
```

### Normal distribution

Maybe the most commonly seen random distribution in real world is the normal distribution. The way to draw normally distributed samples is almost the same with sampling from a uniform distribution. The names of the functions follow the same rules so that we don't have to remember too much.

For example, generate a sample of size 10 from standard normal distribution, that is, with zero mean and unit variance.

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```

To draw sample from non-standard distribution, we only have to specify the two parameters `mean=` for mean and `sd=` for standard deviation.

```{r}
rnorm(10,mean = 10,sd = 5)
```

In addition to the random number generator for normal distribution, R also provides with its probability density function `dnorm()`, cumulative density function `pnorm()`, and quantile function `qnorm()`.

```{r norm,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(rnorm(10000),main="Histogram of rnorm(10000)")
plot(dnorm,xlim=c(-5,5),main="dnorm")
plot(pnorm,xlim=c(-5,5),main="pnorm")
plot(qnorm,xlim=c(0,1),main="qnorm")
```

Here it is obvious that R defines 4 functions for each distribution it supports. 

### Table of supported distributions

The following list contains all built-in distributions and their corresponding random number generating function. 

| Distribution | Random number generator |
|:------------:|-------------------------|
| [Beta distribution](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) | ``r funcall(rbeta)`` |
| [Binomial distribution](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) | ``r funcall(rbinom)`` |

| [Uniform distribution](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_%28continuous%29) | ``r funcall(runif)`` |
| [Weibull distribution](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution) | ``r funcall(rweibull)`` |

The density functions, probability functions, and quantile functions for the above distributions can be easily figured out by following the naming conventions that `rxxx` stands for random numeric generator, `dxxx` for density function, `pxxx` for probability function, and `qxxx` for quantile function.

## Summary statistics

Random distributions are tools to describe the features of random variables. Summary statistics are sometimes of our central interest and informative enough for making descisions.

A few functions calculate specific summary statistics for a given sample. The following table summarizes these functions.

| Statistic | Function |
|:---------:|----------|
| Mean | ``r funcall(mean)``|
| Standard deviation | ``r funcall(sd)`` |
| Variance | ``r funcall(var)`` |
| Corvariance | ``r funcall(cov)`` |
| Correlation | ``r funcall(cor)`` |
| Median | ``r funcall(median)`` |
| Quantile | ``r funcall(quantile)`` |
| Maximum | ``r funcall(max)`` |
| Minimum | ``r funcall(min)`` |
| Range | ``r funcall(range)`` |

The following examples show how these functions can be used. First we generate a random numeric vector of length 30 from standard normal distribution.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(30)
x
```

To see the summary statistics for such a sample, we can call the functions in the table. We can calculate its mean, standard deviation, and median.

```{r}
c(mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x),median=median(x))
```

We can compute its quantiles. `quantile()` by default calculates the 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% quantiles.

```{r}
quantile(x)
```

To customize the quantiles, specify `probs=` argument.

```{r}
quantile(x,probs = c(0.5,0.8))
```

We can call `min()` and `max()` to see its smallest and largest values, respectively. `range()` returns both of them together in a numeric vector.

```{r}
c(min=min(x),max=max(x))
range(x)
```

In addition, `pmin()` and `pmax()` are used to work element-wisely for all vectors.

```{r}
pmax(c(1,2,3),c(2,3,1))
pmin(c(1,2,3),c(2,3,1),c(3,2,1))
```

Also a function named `summary()` can be used to directly show all important location summary statistics.

```{r}
summary(x)
```

In fact, this function is a generic function that works for many types of objects and has different behavior. It is very useful in data analysis. We will cover it in detail later.

## Statistical tests


```{r}
qnorm(c(0.01,0.99))

table(sample(letters[1:3],100,T))
table(sample(letters[1:3],100,T),sample(LETTERS[1:4],100,T))
```
